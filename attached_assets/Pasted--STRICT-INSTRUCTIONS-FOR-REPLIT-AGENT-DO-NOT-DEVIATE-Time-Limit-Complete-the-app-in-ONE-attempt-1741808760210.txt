 STRICT INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPLIT AGENT (DO NOT DEVIATE)
⏳ Time Limit: Complete the app in ONE attempt before first checkpoint
📌 Use PHP (Procedural) + SQLite/MySQL (NO PostgreSQL, Flask, Streamlit, React, or Express)
📌 No unnecessary frameworks – Only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome

📌 Do not ask to change technologies – Follow instructions as written
📌 Ensure all accommodation images display correctly
📌 No missing files or database issues – Everything must be preconfigured
📌 Confirm every major milestone in development but do not pause execution
